# Waveguide

Over the past seven or so years, the increasingly distributed and networked ways in which we experience community online 
within the major social networks of our time has collided with the paradigm shift over to streaming platforms such as Spotify,
Apple Music, and Soundcloud in a really interesting and special way. Across these social networks and streaming platforms, and 
drawing from diverse music scenes such as Trap, Garage, Witch House, and Trance, a global community of artists and fans has 
formed around a set of loose tendencies adding up to be known collectively as wave music.

As both a [creator of](https://soundcloud.com/imjuststarstuff/contact), and fan of this kind of music, I've built this [application](https://waveguide.herokuapp.com/) with the intention of serving that community, seeking for it to act as a directory and hub for artists and all others to use. It also doubles as a portfolio project in which I am seeking to demonstrate a working understanding of the core technologies and design patterns that make up the modern web applications of the day, with a focus on front end development. You can find more information on this artistic community, along with a technical documentation that really dives into the technologies and design patterns that I employed [here](https://waveguide.herokuapp.com/documentation/f161856e-5375-4a66-882f-85b122eb439d).
